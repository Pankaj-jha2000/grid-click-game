**Grid Click Game**

This is a simple grid click game implemented using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game randomly lights up square boxes within a grid upon clicking the start button. When a lit square is clicked, the game records the response time in a table. Additionally, the game provides a reset option that clears both the grid and the table.
